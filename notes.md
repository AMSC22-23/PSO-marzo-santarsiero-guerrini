Well made project, doxygen doc on github pages is very useful (and appreciated!)

A few notes:
 - double check that anybody new to your project is actually able to compile and execute everything as expected (eg, missing `mkdir build`, `/PSO error_iterations`giving `Error opening file`)
 - you could provide also a brief description of what is included in the repo (eg what does the docs dir contains?) and of the expected behaviour for the 3 test you've prepared
